        From Front-End Fumbles to Backend Beginnings

                So, guess what? I have officially wrapped up the front-end development 
                section of my journey and let me just take a moment to give a huge shoutout
                to whoever invented frameworks – you are a lifesaver, my friend! Seriously,
                they have made my developer life a whole lot easier.

            <h3 className='blog-section'>Scary React:</h3>
            <p>
                Now, lets talk about React. Honestly, I used to think it was this big, 
                scary thing I wouldd never understand. But hey, after getting my hands dirty 
                with some React projects in class and even building my portfolio website 
                with it, I have realized it is not so bad. I will not call myself a React 
                guru, but I can make my components dance to the website tune. The only 
                problem? I cannot seem to settle on a design for my site. I mean, I tried 
                wire-framing and all, but once I start coding, I just want to tweak 
                everything. Design struggles, am I right?            
            </p>
            <p>
                And do not even get me started on JSX syntax. At first, I was like, More 
                syntax to learn? No, thanks! But surprise, surprise – it felt like I had 
                seen it somewhere before. Now, with the front-end conquered, it is time to 
                peek under the hood and explore the backend world.            
            </p>
            <h3 className='blog-section'>What Is Next:</h3>
            <p>
                I have dabbled a bit in databases, played around with MySQL schemas, and 
                even mastered the SQL language. And you know what? It is fascinating stuff!
                So, I am psyched to dive into servers, APIs, and all the other backend 
                goodies. Yep, I have decided – I want to be a backend developer.            
            </p>
            <p>
                Next up on my agenda: Node.js and Express.js. Bring it on! Oh, and did I 
                mention our final project? We are diving into machine learning to identify 
                faces in pictures. How cool is that?            
            </p>
            <p>
                So, here is the deal: I am in this journey for the long haul. No quitting, 
                no matter how tough it gets. Lets do this!
